User gave the restaurant 4 rating with review reading ""We stumbled into this place the other night since we had just missed the train, and it was just a couple blocks walking distance from the SEPTA stop! (Luckily, since it was about 20 degrees outside!) This place was the closest thing I\'ve seen to my favorite hole-in-the-wall bar in Tennessee - since I moved to Philadelphia from Tennessee! It was Karaoke night, and the locals sure did pull out their vocal chords and turn on their dancing feet. We got a half-sized Victory Golden Monkey and a pint of Miller Lite for about $10 and just chilled here for an hour. The bartender was very welcoming and friendly, and chatted us up a bit. If I get stuck in East Falls once again, I know where I\'ll go."".'}"
